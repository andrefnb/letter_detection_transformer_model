Master's Degree in Big Data analysis and engeneering. Assignment 2 of the Deep Learning course.

Task 1 

  You must create a convolutional neural network that identifies the license plate characteres in images of chinese cars like those in this task-1 dataset.

Dataset

  It consists of 40 tensorflow tfrecords 1 containing more than 130000 grayscale images of cars with chinese license plates.

Task 2

This task is of a more theoretical nature than the other two tasks. You should write a text (no more than 3 pages) where you compare the 4 different attention mechanism approaches described in [1], [2], [3] and [4]. Assume that we are interested on the application of those mechanisms to image recognition. Keep in mind that you should list the advantages and disadvantages of each approach against the others and not just make a summary of the attention mechanism used on each paper.

Task 3

You must create a model, that identifies the street house numbers in images like those in task-3 dataset, using the attention mechanism presented in Attention-Based Models for Speech Recognition [3].
